### The Gherkin Keyboard Review

This is the review of the gherkin keyboard, a 30% keyboard.

This keyboard is for extreme enthusiasts.

Lets clear some things up:

- Is this a joke?
- Why is it aligned in a grid?
- How can 30 keys be enough?

#### Is this a joke?

Though many keyboard enthusiasts build the gherkin just for the sake of building a gherkin, there are people that actually use it.

Here are some reasons why I think people build/use the gherkin keyboard:

- Build it just for fun.
- Keep it as a collection.
- For secondary use along with other keyboards.
- Use it for stenography.
- Insane people that believe they can use it as a daily driver.

### Why is it aligned in a grid?

This layout is called the ortholinear layout. The grid layout is designed for intuitive typing.

With the gherkin, every key is literally 1 keystroke away making it very easy to touch type.

#### How can 30 keys be enough?

If your coming from a 40% keyboard, you might think that a 30% keyboard is too small.

However, with the use of **layers** **Mod-Tap** and the **IGNORE MOD TAP INTERRUPT** feature, its **easy** to use the gherkin as a daily driver.

It has its flaws but I can still type 85 words per minute on this little thing.

### My current Gherkin layout

Here is my current layout for the Gherkin keyboard. 

#### Layer Zero - Duvorak

This is a standard duvorak layout with the **-** (hyphen) and **x** missing. 

I had to sacrifice the **x** for the more commonly used spacebar.

Some of the keys have 2 symbols: you hold it to activate the first symbol and tap it to activate the second one.

For example if you hold the very **top-left** key it will register as a ctrl key, but if you tap it, it will register as a.

This is how you can fit all of the keystrokes in just 30 keys.

When the **L1, L2, L3, L4** keys are held, they activate different layers making it possible to map this keyboard logically.


#### Layer One - Numbers

The **L1** key enables the numbers as well as the BackSpace Enter and Tab keys.


### Layer two - Symbols

The **L2** key enables my the all the symbols as well as the **x** character.

The **x** is actually not commonly used in english so its not really an issue.


#### Layer three - Shortcuts

This layer is has some useful shortcuts on the left side which is often used with the mouse.

This minimizes having to switch hands between the mouse and the keyboard.

**VirL & VirR** will switch virtual desktops.

**CH L & CH R** are for switching between tabs in chrome.


#### Layer four - Navigation

This is the navigation layer and in my opinion the most important layer.

#### summary

Apart from the **Symbols** layer and the issue with the **X**, I think this layout is quite intuitive. If your coming from a 40% keyboard 
you will need some time adjusting to using your thumb and fingers for the bottom row.

I think that you will agree that the gherkin is definitely capable as a daily driver.


## How can I get one?

You can purchase the gherkin kit from the 40percent clubs website.

Here is what you will need:

### With the Grid:

- 1 grid plate
- 1 gherkin pcb
- 1 bottom plate
- arduino pro micro
- 30 mx or gateron switches
- 30 mx or gateron keycaps
- 30 diodes
- some m2 screws 
- some m2 stands to place between the plates

This gherkin will have the grid to slot the switches in. This guarantees that the switches will be aligned perfectly but the build will be slightly larger.

### Without the Grid:

- 2 gherkin pcb (use the second pcb as the bottom plate)
- arduino pro micro
- 30 mx or gateron switches
- 30 mx or gateron keycaps
- 30 diodes
- some m2 screws
- some m2 stands to place between the plates

You can omit the grids and solder the switches directly on the pcb. The build is smaller compared to the above version but its up to you whether you get everything aligned perfectly or not.

### L E Ds

If you want to add L E Ds, you need additionally:

- a mosfet, a resistor & 30 L E Ds.

Dont get surface mounted L E Ds unless you have flux.

### other things

**Note:** this board is not compatible with **alps** switches.

Also, if you dont like the green pcb, you can download the pcb file somewhere and order your own pcb in a different color.

I got my first gherkin pcb in black.

See the gherkin instructions on the 40percent.clubs website regarding the parts.

I got most of my components such as the stand-offs and screws from Aliexpress.

You can also 3d-print your case if you have a 3d printer.

### soldering

Unless you getting hot-swappable stands from somewhere, youll need to solder all the components to the pcb.

Youll need:

- Soldering Iron
- Solder
- Flush Cutters
- Screw drivers

There are a few gherkin builds on youtube you can follow.

Just becareful of:
- the order you solder the switches and pro micro on the board.
- the orientation of the pro micro when soldering.
- do you want the usb-port on the left or right?
- the pro micros usb port is flimsy; hot glue it in place after the build.

#### Installing the QMK firmware

Once you built the keyboard, you need to flash it with the QMK firmware.

When you flash the board, you need to short circuit the reset and ground pins on the arduino using tweezers or something.

You can follow the official guide on olkb for instructions.

The documentation on docs.qmk.fm is good.

If your on a windows, heres what you probably need:

- msys2 MinGw: from msys2.org
- The qmk code from github

The github page will have some instructions along with a Gherkin folder with the default keyboard layout.

You can customize this layout to your liking before you flash it on your board.

Youll need to run a few commands in the terminal for this.

You can also check my layout on my github.

The link can be found in the description.

#### Conclusion

The gherkin is definitely my favorite keyboard due to its portability.

If I knew what I know now, I probably wouldnt have bothered getting the Planck or the Preonic.

If youve never typed on a mechanical keyboard you should give it a go. They really are amazing to type on.

Another popular choice is the "Anne Pro 2", a 60% bluetooth keyboard with Gateron switches.
